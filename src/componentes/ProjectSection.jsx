    description:`The project is a <span>control application</span> consisting of four parts: <span>communication structure</span> ESP32(server)-PC(client), <span>data processing</span>, <span>API</span>, and <span>data visualization</span>. The connection is made through <span>websockets</span>, and the server sends data to the client in string form. Then, the client uses two data processing functions, one for the <span>VL53L0X sensor</span> and another for the <span>MPU6050</span>. To process and store the data, an <span>API</span> with <span>POST</span> and <span>GET</span> methods is used, which connects to a <span>PostgreSQL</span> database. Finally, the <span>Javascript canvas library</span> is used to visualize the data in the form of <span>line charts</span>.

    In the first part of the project, an <span>ESP32(server)-PC(client) communication structure</span> is used, which connects through <span>websockets</span>, and the server sends data to the client in string form. Then, in the second part, the client uses two <span>data processing</span> functions to manipulate the data it receives from the server and store it in a <span>PostgreSQL</span> database using an <span>API</span> with <span>POST</span> and <span>GET</span> methods. In the third part, an <span>API</span> is used that connects to a <span>PostgreSQL</span> database to process and store the data. Finally, in the last part, the <span>Javascript canvas library</span> is used to visualize the data in the form of <span>line charts</span>.
    
    This project is an example of how a <span>server-client communication</span> structure can be used to process and store data asynchronously. It also shows how <span>data processing</span> functions can be used to manipulate the data received from the server and how data can be visualized using a <span>Javascript library</span>. Overall, this project can be used as a base for future projects that require <span>real-time data processing</span> and <span>data visualization</span>.`,

    description:`This is an IoT-based <span>hydroponic system</span> project that utilizes the nutrient film technique (NFT). The project consists of a <span>pump</span> that uses PVC channels where the plants are placed. The plants receive <span>nutrients from the water</span> that is constantly recirculated through the tubes.

    Recurrent neural networks (RNN) will be used to predict the plant's <span>pH</span> and display the results graphically on a daily basis, optimizing the cultivation time. Although this method is practical, the <span>initial investment cost</span> is high for some individuals. However, since it produces <span>high-quality vegetables</span>, they can be sold as such.
    
    The IoT hydroponic system has an additional functionality that is divided into three main sections: <span>client</span>, <span>graphical user interface</span>, and <span>server</span>. The server section acts as an intermediary between the client and the graphical interface. <span>Sensors</span> measure different parameters such as <span>pH level</span>, <span>water temperature</span>, <span>ambient humidity and temperature</span>, and are used for real-time monitoring and control of the NFT hydroponic system.`,
